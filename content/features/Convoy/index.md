#### Let's make our first package with this extension and see our first VM deployed

9.  Go to 'Products' and then 'Categories' and create a category for your product

10. Go to 'Products' again and click on 'Create Product'

11. Your new product should look like this:

![Alt text](VMProducts.png)

***Notice: The fact that we put in '0' for the price is because we want to test first, that it creates the VM without any manual intervention.

12. After you save your product you should have another tab available called 'Extension', click on it

13. Select the extension 'Convoy' and click on 'Update server'

14. In the fields that just appeared below fill out your desired values for this product, here is an example below:

15. This should be it, now you can order this package from the front page of Paymenter and see your VM being deployed without any issues.

***Notice: I have not put anything in the 'Bandwidth' section, because I don't usually limit the bandwidth used, but you can do that there. Also make sure you have added some IPV4 ip addresses to your Convoy node that you just added earlier in this documentation.
